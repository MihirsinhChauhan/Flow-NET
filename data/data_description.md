Our project will utilize data captured from a high-speed camera made of Photron FASTCAM. Obtaining the images from the camera, the image processing algorithm will deduce useful information such as interface shape; velocity and height of crests, length of slugs formed, etc. This data will be fed to the Machine Learning Algorithm which will be trained on this data to predict future flow parameters, eg. Aeration levels and their physical characteristics like velocity, height, and pressure. This prediction helps prevent sudden pressure rise or large impact forces on the pipe along with the creation of proper flow control systems in hazardous industries like boilers, gas and fuel pipes, nuclear reactors, etc.
