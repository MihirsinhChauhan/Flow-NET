# Flow-NET

 The primary objective of our project is to apply techniques of Image Processing and Machine Learning to the phenomena of Roll waves and wave breaking. Image Processing is a non-intrusive technique of flow visualization. Depending on how well-revised and advanced the algorithm is, image processing will result in better data-capturing from the series of images.
